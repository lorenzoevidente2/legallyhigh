	        	<h1>Meditation</h1>
	        	<p>Meditation is almost exactly the opposite of sleep deprivation. While you experience a general calm with both, meditation brings a calming sense of euphoria to a person’s entire body (and soul). People who meditate compare the high to that of marijuana. The more a person meditates, the easier it becomes for them to slip into that altered state of mind. The best part is that once you are done meditating, the high is done, and you are able to go out and do stuff. </p>

	        	<h1>Binaural Beats</h1>
	        	<p>While this may sound like a lot of nonsense, binaural beats have known to have an effect on a listener’s conscious state. Binaural beats are simply two tones that are extremely close in sound, 400 Hz and 410 Hz for instance. If someone listens to the two tones (one in each ear) the brain will create a third tone. After listening to the tone for a few moments, many listeners are taken over with an overwhelming sense of calm.  </p>

	        	<h1>Self Hypnotism</h1>
	        	<p>There are many different ways to achieve self-hypnotism, but it may be the best possible way to achieve an all-natural high. Many people feel themselves subconsciously transition. It often feels like you’ve sunk into your own head and reach the farthest parts of your brain. Hypnotism is a hard feeling to explain, but one worth experiencing.   </p>

	        	<h1>Fasting</h1>
	        	<p>Going without food or water (or both) for a 24-hour period can be enlightening. Many religions have some type of fast that they take part in to have some type of religious vision. However, the feeling can be mind-altering (in a great way).  </p>

	        	<h1>Hypnagagic Induction</h1>
	        	<p>That’s a mouthful, right? Hypnagagic Induction is simply that in-between-state your mind enters right before you’re in a deep sleep. Practicing Hypnagagic Induction means a person simply stays in that in-between-state. This is often very difficult for people to maintain. In fact, the first few times a person tries they will usually only be able to hold it for a few moments. However, after some practice, people have been able to hold the in-between-state for longer, but you won’t likely remember anything that happened.   </p>
