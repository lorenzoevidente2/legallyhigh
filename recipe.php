	        	<h1>Wonders of Allergy Meds</h1>
	        	<p>Products such as Benadryl contain a powerful antihistamine called Diphenhydramine, a compound that is used at normal doses to treat non-nasal symptoms of allergic reactions.
One of the common side effects of normal Benadryl use is drowsiness. This sedation effect is intensified when the drug is taken in large doses.
One Reddit user described getting high on Benadryl this way:
“You will enter a realm where you will see things that are not real and have absolutely no mechanism for determining what’s real and what isn’t. There is no introspection here. There are no cool textural marks … an impending sense of doom will mark your trip.”</p>

	        	<h1>Cough Syrup Magic</h1>
	        	<p>
	        	 Dextromethorphan (DXM), a compound found in more than 70 over-the-counter cough medicines, was first approved by the FDA more than half a century ago for OTC use. DXM is safe and has no side effects when used in small doses.
	        	 Unfortunately, when taken in large quantities DXM produces an extremely disorienting high. As a result this common ingredient has become a popular alternative to more expensive street drugs.
The effects of DXM can typically last up to 6 hours. This will vary depending on how much DXM is ingested and if there are other substances ingested with it. When combined with alcohol or stimulants, DXM is even more dangerous.
In many cases products with DXM also contain other compounds, such as acetaminophen. When taken regularly in large amounts, acetaminophen can severely damage the liver.
At high doses DXM has been compared to phencyclidine, or PCP. Both are considered dissociative substances that can cause the user to feel detached from reality and have what is akin to an out-of-body experience.
When DXM is abused at high doses for a prolonged period of time, it can result in a mental condition called chemical psychosis. In this state the user loses all contact with reality and may require immediate hospitalization to prevent harm to themselves or others.

	        	<p>Almost any product that is in a pressurized container can be used as an inhalant. Products such as glue, markers, and rubber cement may not be pressurized, but they still produce powerful vapors that are extremely dangerous when inhaled.
                  Even though many of these products have different ingredients, they all produce similar effects. Expect limited brain function, decreased motor skills and slurred speech.</p>
